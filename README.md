# dockerproj

The project is still in working , the actual project i wanted to create is to convert the python script I've written in Docker folder (main.py) to the Web App and adding some more features to it. However some of the features i've added in web app . 

# Requirements: 
* Node server should be running on your machine.
* all the dependencies should be installed which are under package.json .
* Docker should be installed in your system.* 
#### (YOU can install docker by running the script main.py in your system)  ###

# How to run the app:
* Download the repository in your local machine.
* Install Docker ( using main.py )
    * just run the command  python3  main.py 
    the program will prompt you to enter your choice according to the needs.
* Install nodejs 
* run node app.js
* go to the port 3000 of your private IP
 that's it you're good to go.
 
 
 ## you can run whole webapp operations using main.py script only , it also contains much more features than the Web app.
 
# note: you may face some issue with pull image button , while pulling bigger images like ubuntu, debian etc. smaller images are working fine like alpine. To pull images bigger in size use main.py
