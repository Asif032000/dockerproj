# dockerproj

The project is still in working , the actual project i wanted to create is to convert the python script I've written in Docker folder to the Web App and adding some more features to it. However some of the features i've added in web app . 

# Requirements: 
* Node server should be running on your machine.
* all the dependencies should be installed which are under package.json .
* Docker should be installed in your system.* 
#### (YOU can install docker by running the script Dockernew.py in your system)  ###

# How to run the app:
* Download the repository in your local machine.
* Install Docker ( using Dockernew.py )
    * just run the command  python3  Dockernew.py 
    the program will prompt you to enter your choice according to the needs.
* Install nodejs 
* run node app.js
 that's it you're good to go.
 
 
 ## you can run whole webapp operations using Dockernew.py script only , it also contains much more features than the Web app.
